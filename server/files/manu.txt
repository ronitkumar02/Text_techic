1. 
Petitioners claim to be engaged in the business of designing, developing,
manufacturing, marketing and/or sale of telecommunications related products
worldwide. According to petitioners, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) invited bids
for planning, supply, installation and commissioning of IMPCS 20/30 Combo Network
(Phase V) vide tender No. : MM/CMTS/032006/000301 dated 22.03.2006 and B&CCS
(Billing and Customer Care System including DR) and COTS Solution, which were part
of overall IMPCS 20/30 network (Phase V) solution 
designed by petitioners, were to be
delivered to the BSNL as per tender specifications and requirement. For this purpose,
petitioners entered into Cooperation Agreement Nos. PACIND3009032002RUB &
PACCHNHW09032002 RUA dated 20.03.2009 with the respondent.
2. 
During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that
Clause 4.4 of the Agreement clearly stipulated that time is of the essence under the
agreement and the respondent is obligated to follow the project time line and ensure
that no delay is there in supply and implementation; Clause 4.5 of Agreement stipulated
that the respondent was to provide (one) year Operation and Maintenance support;
Clauses 4.6 and 10.3 of the Agreements read with Clause 1.2.1 stipulated that
respondent was required to provide three years' 7X24 warranty services from the date
of commissioning of the complete network in the service area. It was also submitted
that respondent was responsible for bearing all the expenses for repair and replacement
of the supplied solution and provide the same free of charge to the petitioners during
the subsistence of the warranty period. It was also stipulated in both the Agreements
that in case BSNL imposes any penalty on the petitioners due to delay in
restoration/replacement/fixing of the fault with 
B&CCS and COTS solution, the
respondent shall pay the complete penalty imposed and also if the respondent has to
get the defects remedied from a third party, that shall be at complete risk and expense

3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that based on the aforesaid
agreements and assurances, the petitioners issued four purchase orders to respondent
for hardware implementation, integration of B&CCS and other components, integration
of new element with billing system and performance tuning with expanded billing
system, disaster recovery and business continuity system, application, software, drives,
modem, printer, web based application with customizable OUI for data analysis and
COTS package. According to petitioners, the aforesaid work was commissioned after a
delay on 25.06.2012 and was valid till 24.06.2013 and the associated warranted for
complete solution/products supplied was valid till 24.06.2015.
4. 
Learned counsel next submitted that during the subsistence of warranty period under
the said agreements, BSNL raised several issues with regard to solution and products
supplied by the respondent, however, respondent in direct breach of its contractual
obligation did not 
rectify/resolve certain issues. Several e-mails and communications
were made by the petitioners to the respondent during that one year requesting
respondent to fix the issues and admittedly, in a few of the communications, respondent
acknowledged the pending issues and assured the petitioners that all the issues will be
resolved/rectified. In order to rectify the defects and due to inaction of respondent,
petitioners engaged a Third-Party Vendor and in terms of the agreements, the third
party vendor was wholly at the risk and cost of respondent and the same was informed
to the respondent.
5. 
According to counsel for petitioners, thereafter meetings were held between
petitioners and respondent on 26.10.2016; 06.12.2016; 15.11.2018 and 27.11.2018
wherein respondent always assured the petitioners that their team will check the claims
of petitioners and revert, however, respondent failed to perform its contractual
obligation.
6. 
Learned counsel further submitted that due to non-resolution/rectification of
open/pending issues with the Servers and Storage, BSNL imposed penalty amounting to
INR 3,62,46,055 on petitioners for the period 2015-2017, which accrued only due to
voluntary inaction, breach of warranty terms and non-adherence to contractual
obligations by the 
respondent. Additionally, BSNL has withheld Huawei's Bank
Guarantee (BG) amounting to INR 7,72,23,487, which may be encashed by BSNL due to
inaction of respondent.
7. 
Further, during subsistence of the Agreements respondent did not avail technical
support from ORACLE and petitioners got to know about it only when it demanded the
complete payment of Technical Support charges from December 2010 onwards from the
petitioners before providing any further service, which respondent is solely liable to
pay.
8. 
Learned counsel for petitioners next submitted that due to respondent's inaction to
resolve the issues with BSNL and upon failure of discussions between the parties,
petitioners sent Legal Notice dated 21.12.2018 to respondent to come up with
resolution plan within seven days. Though the said letter was replied by the respondent
vide communication dated 03.01.2019, however, it only stated that the detailed
response shall follow, which respondent never did. Thereafter, petitioners were
constrained to send legal notice dated 14.03.2019 to respondent invoking arbitration
under Clause 18 of the Agreements and proposed name of Justice (Retd.) R.C. Chopra
as the sole arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes and called upon the respondent to
05-07-2022 (Page 2 of 8)                          www.manupatra.com                              Manupatra .consent to the 
same. However, the said communication was not replied to and
therefore, this petition has been filed seeking appointment of sole Arbitrator by this
Court.
9. 
On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent submitted that
the disputes between the parties are not at all arbitrable and hence, the present petition
deserves outright rejection. Learned counsel submitted that the claims raised by the
petitioners are highly time barred, which purportedly pertain to Agreements dated
20.03.2009, according to which respondent were to provide warranty services for three
years and the cause of action is not a continuous cause of action and also that the
maximum period of three years under the limitation expired in December, 2017 and,
therefore, the present petition deserves to be rejected on the point of limitation alone.
Learned counsel submitted that even if it is assumed that the purported e-mails were
exchanged between the parties, yet the e-mail was written by the respondent in the year
2016 and notice invoking arbitration by the petitioners is of the year 2019 and thereby,
this petition fails on limitation.
10. 
Reliance was placed upon Hon'ble Supreme Court's decision dated 06.03.2021 in
BSNL Vs. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd., MANU/SC/0171/2021 : (2021) 5 SCC 738 to
submit that merely by exchange of letters and discussions, period of limitation for
issuing of notice invoking arbitration, shall not be extended and also that Section 5 to
20 of the Limitation Act do not exclude the time taken on settlement discussions.
Reliance was also placed upon another decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Geo Miller
Vs. Chairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited MANU/SC/1198/2019 : 2020
(14) SCC 643 to submit that petition under Section 11(6) of the Act was rejected as the
claims were hopelessly time barred.
11. 
It was submitted by learned counsel for respondent that by filing this petition,
petitioners are trying to revive the dead claims and there is no continuing cause of
action in the present case. Reliance was also placed upon Hon'ble Supreme Court's
decisions in Balkrishna Savalram Pujari & Ors. Vs. Shree Dnyaneshwar Maharaj
Sansthan & Ors. MANU/SC/0174/1959 : AIR 1959 SC 798 and M. Siddique Vs. Mahant
Suresh Das in support of above submissions.
12. 
Learned counsel next submitted that neither Agreement was executed nor any
breaches were committed within the territorial 
jurisdiction of this Court, therefore, this
Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the present petition under the provisions of
Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. It was next submitted that neither of
the parties work for gain at New Delhi; the cause of action has not accrued at New
Delhi; the agreement was not executed in New Delhi but in Gurgaon and none of the
payments has been received in New Delhi, moreover no breached were committed
within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction
to adjudicate this petition under Section 11 of the Act.
13. 
Learned counsel further submitted that the arbitration clause contained in Para-
18.2.1 notes that the place of arbitration shall be New Delhi and this would not confer
any jurisdiction upon this Court to entertain this petition. It was submitted that seat and
venue are two different legal issues and place of arbitration cannot give the status of
the juridical seat.
14. 
Learned counsel submitted that all disputes between the parties were settled in a
meeting dated 21.12.2015, whereunder petitioners and respondent had agreed to
liquidate the damages at 6.5% of total Purchase Order value and thereby, differential
05-07-2022 (Page 3 of 8)                          www.manupatra.com                              Manupatra .amount of INR 16,151,717.51 was 
paid by respondent to petitioners on 11.03.2016,
which fact is concealed by the petitioners.
15. 
To refute petitioners' claim that the defects were got rectified by a third party on
19.05.2017 at the risk and cost of respondent, learned counsel placed reliance upon
decision of a Division Bench of this Court in Ancient Infratech Vs. NBCC wherein it was
held that the cause of action has to have a cut-off date of determination irrespective of
letters demanding completion of work and therefore, rectification of work by a third
party cannot renew the period of limitation.
16. 
Reliance was also placed upon Hon'ble Supreme Court's decision in Sundaram
Finance Vs. Noorjhan Biwi 
2003 (16) SCC 1
 to submit that where there was a breach in
payment of instalments, the limitation ran from the date of the first default of payment.
17. 
Learned counsel further submitted that both the Agreements in question are
independent of each other and cannot be bound for the purpose of Section 11 of the
Act. With regard to claims raised by the petitioners, learned counsel submitted that
these are false, baseless and without any merit. Hence, dismissal of the present petition
is sought.
18. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for petitioners submitted that 
respondent's plea seeking
dismissal of the present petition on the ground of limitation is to be rejected as even
though the warranty period got over by 24.06.2015, thereafter, petitioners and
respondent have been in continuous exchange of e-mails and holding meetings on
regular intervals from 2015 till 2018. It is only when on 27.11.2018 that the respondent
for the first time declined to rectify the pending issues, the petitioners sent a legal
notice on 21.12.2018 and finally, invoked arbitration on 14.03.2019. Hence, the claims
raised by petitioners cannot be treated as "dead wood" as stated by respondent.
Reliance was placed upon decisions in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd.,
MANU/SC/0171/2021 : (2021) 5 SCC 738 and Vidya Drolia Vs. Durga Trading Corpn.
MANU/SC/0939/2020 : (2021) 2 SCC 1.
19. 
The arguments advanced by both the sides were heard at length and the material
placed on record as well as decisions relied upon have been perused.
20. 
The foremost question which is first required to be answered is whether this Court
has jurisdiction to entertain the present petition.
21. 
In reply to the present petition, it is averred by the respondent that since one of the
parties to the Agreements is not an Indian national, therefore, disputes, if any, shall be
governed under the international 
arbitration as defined under Section 2(f) of the Act and
also that the provisions of Section 11(4) of the Act make it clear that in case where
international commercial arbitration has to take place, only the Hon'ble Supreme Court
shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator. However, during the
course of hearing, no submission was made in this regard and therefore, this Court has
not gone into this question.
22. 
Relevantly, it is not disputed that the Cooperation Agreement dated 20.03.2009 in
question contains the arbitration clause, which reads as under:-
"18.2 Resolution of disputes
18.2
.1 The Agreement will be governed by the laws of India All disputes,
controversies or claims arising out of or in connection with or in relation to this
05-07-2022 (Page 4 of 8)                          www.manupatra.com                              Manupatra .Contract or its negotiation, performance, breach, existence or validity, whether
contractual or tortuous, shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and conducted by a single Arbitrator to
be appointed by the Parties by mutual consent. The cost of the arbitration shall
be shared by the Parties. The place of the arbitration shall be New Delhi, India.
The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English language. The award
of the arbitration shall be final and binding against the Parties hereto.
23. 
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in BGS SGS SOMA JV Vs. NHPC, MANU/SC/1715/2019 :
(2020) 4 SCC 234 has held as under:-
"82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it may be concluded that
whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration
clause as being the "venue" of the arbitration proceedings, the expression
"arbitration proceedings" would make it clear that the "venue" is really the
"seat" of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include
just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration
proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place. This
language has to be contrasted with language such as "tribunals are to meet or
have witnesses, experts or the parties" where only hearings are to take place in
the "venue", which may lead to the conclusion, other things being equal, that
the venue so stated is not the "seat" of arbitral proceedings, but only a
convenient place of meeting. Further, the fact that the arbitral proceedings
"shall be held" at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties
intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby,
that that place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with there
being no other significant contrary indicia that the stated venue is merely a
"venue" and not the "seat" of the arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively
show that such a clause designates a "seat" of the arbitral proceedings. In an
international context, if a supranational body of rules is to govern the
arbitration, this would further be an indicia that "the venue", so stated, would
be the seat of the arbitral proceedings. In a national context, this would be
replaced by the Arbitration Act, 1996 as applying to the "stated venue", which
then becomes the "seat" for the purposes of 
arbitration."
24. 
Hence, the contention of respondent that seat and venue are two different legal
issues and place of arbitration cannot give the status of the juridical seat, is liable to be
rejected and this Court is well within its jurisdiction to entertain this petition.
25. 
Another question, which is raised in the present petition is that the claims raised by
the petitioners are ex facie highly time barred. To seek dismissal of present petition on
this ground, respondent has placed reliance upon various decisions and this Court has
gone through the same.
26. 
In Geo Miller Vs. Chairman (Supra) relied upon by the respondent, the final bill was
handed over on 10.08.1989; three years period ended on 10.08.1992; notice invoking
arbitration was sent in 2002 and petition under Section 11 was filed in the year 2003
and thereby, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that there was inordinate delay of 14
years and upheld the decision passed by High Court of Rajasthan dismissing petition
under Section 11 of the Act.
27. 
The decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Balkrishna Savalram Pujari (Supra) and
M. Siddique (Supra) relied upon by the respondent, are distinguishable on facts and is
05-07-2022 (Page 5 of 8)                          www.manupatra.com                              Manupatra .of no assistance to the case in hand.
28. 
In Vidya Drolia (Supra) relied upon by the petitioners, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has dealt with the scope of judicial review under Sections 8 and 11 of the Act.
29. 
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in BSNL Vs. Nortel Network (India) (P) Ltd. (Supra) has
extensively dealt with the issue of determining limitation period in filing a petition
under Section 11 of the Act as well as issue whether a Court exercising jurisdiction
under Section 11 of the Act is obligated to appoint an Arbitrator where the claims are
ex-facie time barred.
30. 
With regard to first issue i.e. determining the period of limitation in filing petition
under Section 11 of the Act, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in BSNL Vs. Nortel Network
(Supra) has held as under:-
"15. It is now fairly well-settled that the limitation for filing an application
under Section 11 would arise upon the failure to make the appointment of the
arbitrator within a period of 30 days from issuance of the notice invoking
arbitration. In other words, an application under Section 11 can be filed only
after a notice of arbitration in respect of the particular 
claim(s)/dispute(s) to be
referred to arbitration [as contemplated by Section 21 of the Act] is made, and
there is failure to make the appointment.
16. 
The period of limitation for filing a petition seeking appointment of an
arbitrator(s) cannot be confused or conflated with the period of limitation
applicable to the substantive claims made in the underlying commercial
contract. The period of limitation for such claims is prescribed under various
Articles of the Limitation Act, 1963. The limitation for deciding the underlying
substantive disputes is necessarily distinct from that of filing an application for
appointment of an arbitrator. This position was recognised even under Section
20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. Reference may be made to the judgment of this
Court in J.C. Budhraja v. Orissa Mining Corpn. Ltd. [J.C. Budhraja v. Orissa
Mining Corpn. Ltd., MANU/SC/0602/2008 : (2008) 2 SCC 444: (2008) 1 SCC
(Civ) 582] wherein it was held that Section 37(3) of the 1940 Act provides that
for the purpose of the Limitation Act, an arbitration is deemed to have
commenced when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other
party, a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. Para 26 of this
judgment reads as follows: (SCC p. 460)
"26. Section 37(3) of the Act provides that for the purpose of the
Limitation Act, an arbitration is deemed to have been commenced when
one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other party
thereto, a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. Such 
a
notice having been served on 4-6-1980, it has to be seen whether the
claims were in time as on that date. If the claims were barred on 4-6-
1980, it follows that the claims had to be rejected by the arbitrator on
the ground that the claims were barred by limitation. The said period
has nothing to do with the period of limitation for filing a petition
under Section 8(2) of the Act. Insofar as a petition under Section 8(2)
is concerned, the cause of action would arise when the other party fails
to comply with the notice invoking arbitration. Therefore, the period of
limitation for filing a petition under Section 8(2) seeking appointment
of an arbitrator cannot be confused with the period of limitation for
05-07-2022 (Page 6 of 8)                          www.manupatra.com                              Manupatra .making a claim. The decisions of this Court in Inder Singh Rekhi v.
DDA [Inder Singh Rekhi v. DDA, MANU/SC/0271/1988 : (1988) 2 SCC
338], Panchu Gopal Bose v. Port of Calcutta [Panchu Gopal Bose v. Port
of Calcutta, MANU/SC/0385/1994 : (1993) 4 SCC 338] and Utkal
Commercial Corpn. v. Central Coal Fields Ltd. [Utkal Commercial
Corpn. v. Central Coal Fields Ltd., MANU/SC/0028/1999 : (1999) 2 SCC
571] also make this position clear."
19. 
The reasoning in all these judgments seems to be 
that since an application
under Section 11 is to be filed in a court of law, and since no specific Article of
the Limitation Act, 1963 applies, the residual Article would become applicable.
The effect being that the period of limitation to file an application under Section
11 is 3 years from the date of refusal to appoint the arbitrator, or on expiry of
30 days, whichever is earlier."
31. 
Applying the afore-noted observations to the case in hand, this Court finds that in
the present case, the agreement in question contains an arbitration clause. For
resolution of disputes with regard to work order in question, petitioners first sent Legal
Notice dated 21.12.2018 to respondent calling upon to provide a resolution plan within
seven days, which was replied by the respondent vide its communication dated
03.01.2019 stating therein the respondent was under the process of reviewing the
allegations and claims raised by the petitioners and a details response shall be shared
shortly. Thereafter, petitioners sent a legal notice dated 14.03.2019 to respondent
invoking arbitration wherein name of Justice (Retd.) R.C. Chopra was proposed for
appointment as Arbitrator, which was not replied to. The period of limitation of three
years will be counted from the expiry of refusal to reply to appointment of Arbitrator
within 30 days of invoking arbitration by notice, which in 
this case shall be 13.04.2019.
The present petition was filed before this Court on 24.05.2019 and in this manner, there
is no delay in filing the present petition.
32. 
On the second question raised in the present petition by the respondent that the
claims raised by the petitioners are ex facie highly time barred, reliance was again
placed by respondent upon decision in BSNL Vs. Nortel Network (Supra) to submit that
the period of limitation in issuing the notice of arbitration would not get extended by
mere exchange of letters or mere settlement discussions and the case of petitioners is a
deadwood. Relevantly, in BSNL Vs. Nortel Network (Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court
had dealt with a case where the notice invoking arbitration was issued after 5Â½ years
of rejection of claims and there was no averment either in the notice of arbitration or
the petition filed under Section 11 of the Act or before the Supreme Court any
intervening facts which would have extended the limitation period. However, in the said
case the Hon'ble Supreme Court on this question has observed as under:-
"47. It is only in the very limited category of cases, where there is not even a
vestige of doubt that the claim is ex facie time-barred, or that the dispute is
non-arbitrable, that the court may decline to make 
the reference. However, if
there is even the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the disputes to arbitration,
otherwise it would encroach upon what is essentially a matter to be determined
by the tribunal."
33. 
In view of afore-noted observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court, this court has once
again tested the minute details of this case to find out whether the claims raised by the
petitioners are stale and ex facie time barred and liable to be rejected.
05-07-2022 (Page 7 of 8)                          www.manupatra.com                              Manupatra .34. 
Pertinently, with regard to Agreement dated 20.03.2009, work was commissioned
after a delay on 25.06.2012 and respondent was required to give one year maintenance
and three years operation warranty and so, the Operation and Maintenance period was
valid till 24.06.2013 and the warranty was valid till 24.06.2015. With regard to issues
raised by their client-BSNL, petitioners had written several e-mails dated 1.09.2015,
23.09.2015, 17.11.2015, 21.12.2015, 25.01.2016, 03.02.2016, 08.03.2016, 27.04.2016
and 26.10.2016 to respondent for rectification and resolution of pending issues and a
few of them were replied by the respondent vide e-mail dated 28.12.2015, 07.01.2016,
03.02.2016. Besides, both sides held meetings on 15.11.2018 and 27.11.2018. The first
legal notice was sent on 21.12.2018, which was replied by the respondent 03.01.2019
stating that the detailed response shall be given 
and thereafter, on 14.03.2019 notice
invoking arbitration was sent by the petitioners nominating its Arbitrator. However,
since the said notice was not replied to within 30 days, petitioners filed the present
petition on 24.05.2019. Without going into the details of these e-mails and minutes of
meeting held between the parties, this Court finds that there has been continuous cause
of action and persistent demand raised on the part of petitioner and thereby, the claims
raised cannot be said to be decayed.
35. 
So far as plea of respondent that the claims raised by respondent that all disputes
stood already settled in terms recorded in the Minutes of Meeting dated 21.12.2015 or
that there are two distinct agreements which cannot be consolidated or that the defects
which were got rectified by a third party at the risk and cost of respondent, are
questions of claims which shall be considered and decided by the learned Arbitrator.
36. 
Pertinently, execution of Cooperation Agreement dated 20.03.2009 between the
parties; existence of arbitration Clause-18.2 therein and invocation of arbitration by
virtue of notice dated 14.03.2019 is not disputed. Also, terms of Clause-18.2 the
disputes have to be referred to a single Arbitrator
37. 
Accordingly, the present petition is allowed and Mr. Justice G.S. Sistani (Retd.)
Mobile: 9871300034 is appointed the sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute between
the parties.
38. 
The fee of the learned Arbitrator shall be governed by the Fourth Schedule of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
39. 
The learned Arbitrator shall ensure compliance of Section 12 of Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 before commencing the arbitration.
40. 
The present petition and pending application, if any, are accordingly disposed of.
