The agreement is a legal document, outlining the terms of the contract between the parties involved.
It's important to carefully review and understand the contents of the agreement, especially when it comes to timelines and obligations.
Clause 4.4 specifically states that time is of the essence in the agreement, meaning any delays can have serious consequences.
Additionally, Clause 4.5 outlines the respondent's responsibility for providing operation and maintenance support for a period of one year.
Other important clauses include 10.3, which relates to the scope of work, and 1.2.1, which defines key terms used in the agreement.

The writing style should be logical and easy to understand.
Complete payment of Technical Support charges from December 2010 onwards, petitioners demand before providing any further service.
Respondent is liable for paying these charges.
Legal Notice dated 21.12.2018 sent to respondent to come up with resolution plan within seven days.
Response from respondent was delayed and did not include a detailed response as promised.
Petitioners had to send another legal notice on 14.03.2019 invoking arbitration under Clause 18 of the Agreements and proposing Justice (Retd.) R.C. Chopra as the sole arbitrator.
The respondent was called upon to consent to the appointment of a sole arbitrator, but failed to do so without any valid reason or ground.
The petitioner filed this petition seeking appointment of a sole arbitrator by the court.
Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the disputes between the parties are not arbitrable and therefore, the present petition deserves outright rejection.
The claims raised by the petitioners are time-barred as they pertain to agreements dated 20.03.2009, which expired in December 2017.
There is no arbitration agreement between the parties and therefore, any claim made after such date would be barred by time.
The court considered the rival submissions and perused the materials on record before directing the respondent to communicate his consent for the appointment of a sole arbitrator within 10 days from the date of the order.
If the respondent fails to comply with this direction, it shall be deemed that he has waived his right to object to the petition and the sole arbitrator shall forthwith be appointed in accordance with Section 11 of the Act read with Rule 45(2) of the Rules.
The user argues that the petition should be rejected based on the point of limitation alone, as it was filed beyond the three-year period.
Learned counsel for the user submits that even if emails were exchanged between parties, notice invoking arbitration in 2019 is still barred by limitation since the last email was written in 2016.
Reliance is placed on BSNL v Nortel Networks (India) P Ltd to argue that mere exchange of letters and discussions does not extend the period of limitation for issuing notice invoking arbitration, and Section 5-20 of Limitation Act do not exclude time taken on settlement discussions.
Another decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court is also relied upon in support of this argument.
Reliance was placed on another Supreme Court decision (Geo Miller vs. Chairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited) to argue that the petition under Section 11(6) of the Act was rejected because the claims were time-barred.
It was argued by learned counsel for the respondent that the petitioners are trying to revive dead claims and there is no continuing cause of action in the present case.
Reliance was placed on Supreme Court decisions (Balkrishna Savalram Pujari & Ors. vs. Shree Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Sansthan & Ors. and M. Siddique vs. Mahant Suresh Das) in support of these submissions.
Learned counsel next argued that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the present petition because neither agreement was executed nor any breaches occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.
Court has no jurisdiction under Section 11 of Arbitration Act to entertain present petition
Neither party works in New Delhi, cause of action didn't accrue there
Agreement was executed in Gurgaon and payments weren't received there either
No breaches occurred within territorial jurisdiction of this Court
Jurisdictional point: arbitration clause specifies place of arbitration is New Delhi, but that doesn't give Court jurisdiction to hear petition.
Learned counsel submitted that all disputes between parties were settled in a meeting dated 21.12.2015, whereunder petitioners and respondent had agreed to liquidate the damages at 6.5% of total Purchase Order value and thereby, differential amount of INR 16,151,717.51 was paid by respondent to petitioners on 11.03.2016, which fact is concealed by the petitioners.
To refute petitioners' claim that the defects were got rectified by a third party on 19.05.2017 at the risk and cost of respondent, learned counsel placed reliance upon decision of a Division Bench of this Court in Ancient Infratech Vs. NBCC wherein it was held that the cause of action has to have a cut-off date of determination irrespective of letters demanding completion of work and therefore, rectification of work by a third party cannot renew the period of limitation.
Petitioner's counsel submitted that there is no agreement between parties on liquidation amount & same is not mentioned in any document. Counsel further stated that petitioners have already spent money for rectification work and hence, respondent should be responsible to pay the cost of such work as well.
Learned counsel for respondent submitted that parties had agreed in their meeting on 21.12.2015 to liquidate damages at 6.5% of total Purchase Order value & therefore, petitioner's claim for additional cost is not tenable. Counsel further stated that rectification work was done by third party & same cannot be used as basis to enhance the period of limitation.
Learned counsel for respondent submitted that parties have already agreed upon liquidation amount in their meeting on 21.12.2015, which is duly reflected in the minutes of the said meeting & therefore, petitioner's claim for additional cost is not sustainable.
The matter has been heard and considered. I find that there is no agreement between parties on liquidation amount as claimed by petitioners. Moreover, rectification work was done by third party & same cannot be used to enhance the period of limitation. In view of above, I dismiss the petition with cost.
The matter is accordingly disposed off. (Signature of Judge)

Jurisdictional issues are not a new concept, as the court has already
The arbitration clause is clear and unambiguous, and it does not
The Agreement will be governed by Indian law. • Any disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or relating to this contract or its negotiation, performance, breach, existence or validity shall be referred to arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.
The cost of arbitration will be shared by both parties. • The place of arbitration is New Delhi, India.
The arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English language. • The final award of the arbitration shall be binding on both parties.
82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it may be concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the "venue" of the arbitration proceedings, the expression "arbitration proceedings" would make it clear that the "venue" is really the "seat" of the arbitral proceedings.
The language used in the arbitration clause does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place. This language has to be contrasted with language such as "tribunals are to meet or have witnesses, experts or the parties" where only hearings are to take place in the "venue", which may lead to the conclusion, other things being equal, that the venue so stated is not the "seat" of arbitral proceedings, but only a convenient place of meeting.
The fact that the arbitral proceedings have commenced at the designated place of arbitration does not necessarily mean that the seat of the arbitration has been determined.
The place where arbitral proceedings are held shall be considered as the seat of arbitration.
The fact that the clause specifies a particular venue for the arbitration indicates that the parties intended to designate it as the seat of the proceedings.
In an international context, if a supranational body of rules governs the arbitration, this further supports the conclusion that the specified venue is the seat of the proceedings.
In a national context, the Arbitration Act, 1996 would apply to the stated venue, making it the seat of the arbitration for the purposes of the law.
The issue before the court is whether a Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 of the Act is obligated to appoint an Arbitrator where the claims are ex-facie time barred.
In BSNL Vs. Nortel Network (Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the period of limitation for filing a petition seeking appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 commences from the date on which such notice of arbitration is served.
The court further held that the application under section 11 can be filed only after a notice of arbitration in respect of the particular claim(s)/dispute(s) to be referred to arbitration [as contemplated by Section 21 of the Act] is made, and there is failure to make the appointment.
The period of limitation for filing an application under section 11 starts from the date of service of notice of arbitration.
Period of limitation for filing a petition seeking appointment of an arbitrator cannot be confused or conflated with the period of limitation applicable to the substantive claims made in the underlying commercial contract.
The period of limitation for such claims is prescribed under various Articles of the Limitation Act, 1963.
The limitation for deciding the underlying substantive disputes is necessarily distinct from that of filing an application for appointment of an arbitrator.
This position was recognised even under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940.
Reference may be made to the judgment of this Court in J.C. Budhraja v. Orissa Mining Corpn. Ltd., wherein it was held that Section 37(3) of the 1940 Act provides that for the purpose of the Limitation Act, an arbitration is deemed to have commenced when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other party.
The arbitration agreement commences when one party serves a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator on the other party. (SCC p. 460)
According to Section 37(3) of the Act, for Limitation Act purposes, the arbitration is deemed to have been commenced when the notice was served. (SCC p. 460)
The claims were in time if they were barred on the date the notice was served (i.e., June 4-6, 1980). (SCC p. 460)
If the claims were barred on that date, they had to be rejected by the arbitrator on the ground of limitation. (SCC p. 460)
The period for filing a petition under Section 8(2) of the Act has nothing to do with the period of limitation for commencing an arbitration. (SCC p. 460)
Insofar as a petition under Section 8(2) is concerned, the cause of action arises when the other party fails to appoint an arbitrator. (SCC p. 460)
The period of limitation for filing a petition under Section 8(2) seeking appointment of an arbitrator cannot be confused with the period of limitation for making a claim.
The decisions of Inder Singh Rekhi v. DDA, Panchu Gopal Bose v. Port of Calcutta and Utkal Commercial Corpn. v. Central Coal Fields Ltd. make it clear that an application under Section 11 is to be filed in a court of law.
The decisions further clarify that the period of limitation for filing a petition under Section 11 is governed by Article 137 of the Limitation Act.
Under Section 11, an application must be filed in court within 3 years from refusal to appoint arbitrator or expiry of 30 days.
The allegations and claims raised by the petitioners will be shared shortly.
Petitioners sent a legal notice dated 14.03.2019 to respondent, invoking arbitration wherein Justice (Retd.) R.C. Chopra was proposed for appointment as Arbitrator.
The response to the appointment of Arbitrator was not replied within 30 days, hence the period of limitation of three years will be counted from the expiry of refusal to reply to appointment of Arbitrator.
The present petition was filed before this Court on 24.05.2019 and there is no delay in filing the same.
The respondent's claim that the claims raised by the petitioners are ex facie highly time-barred, has been rejected based on a previous decision of BSNL Vs. Nortel Network (Supra).
The period of limitation for issuing a notice of arbitration will not be extended by mere exchange of letters or settlement discussions.
The court will only decline to make a reference in cases where there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is time-barred or non-arbitrable.
Petitioners had written several e-mails to respondent from September 2015 to October 2016 regarding rectification and resolution of pending issues.
Respondent replied to some of these e-mails, but did not address the remaining issues raised by petitioners.
Both sides held meetings in November 2018 and February 2019 without resolving the disputes.
Petitioners sent a legal notice on December 2018 which was replied by respondent stating that detailed response would be provided later.
Petitioners nominated their arbitrator and sent a notice invoking arbitration on March 2019, but respondent did not reply to the notice within 30 days.
Petitioners filed the present petition on May 24, 2019 due to continuous cause of action despite several attempts at resolution through communication and meetings between the parties.
The parties had a meeting where they discussed their claims and demands.
The court found that there has been continuous cause of action and persistent demand, so the claims cannot be considered invalid.
The respondent raised several pleas, including that all disputes were settled in a previous meeting or that there are two separate agreements that can't be consolidated. These will be decided by the arbitrator.
The execution of the cooperation agreement and invocation of arbitration through notice dated 14.03.2019 is not disputed.
According to Clause-18.2, any disputes must be referred to a single arbitrator.
Disputes have to be referred to a single Arbitrator.
Mr. Justice G.S. Sistani (Retd.) is appointed the sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute between parties.
The fee of the learned Arbitrator shall be governed by the Fourth Schedule of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
The learned Arbitrator shall ensure compliance of Section 12 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before commencing the arbitration.
The present petition and pending application, if any, are accordingly disposed of.
