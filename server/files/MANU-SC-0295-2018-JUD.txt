2.Appellants  have  filed  these  appeals  challenging  the  judgment
dated 27.03.2012 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay Bench at
Aurangabad in W.P. No. 4669 of 2011 in and by which the High Court
held that challenge to the arbitral award dated 07.07.1996 was time
barred  under  the  provisions  of  Section  34  of  the  Arbitration  and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short "the Act").
3.The facts of the case are that the appellant No.1/Anilkumar Patel
and respondent No.1/Pravinchandra Patel are real brothers and sons of
1Jinabhai. They had three other brothers who were already separated.
So far as the parties before us, they are related as under:-

[*Respondent Nos. 6 to 9 have been deleted as respondents and added as LRs of the appellant vide order
dated 30.04.2015 in the SLP] 
Pravinchandra Patel and Anilkumar Patel together started the business
of fertilizer manufacturing, chemical and real estate at Jalgaon. In the
course of business, they set up number of companies and partnership
concerns and acquired numerous immovable and movable properties.
Pravinchandra Patel has three daughters, who are married and settled
outside Jalgaon. Anilkumar Patel has three sons, who are residing with
him at Jalgaon. As children of Pravinchandra Patel and Anilkumar Patel
grew up and in order to avoid any possible litigation, both the brothers
and their family members decided to make division of the assets of the
family.   For  this  purpose,  they  approached  Latikaben  (respondent
2No.12)  and  Bhikhalal  Nathalal  Patel  (respondent  No.11)  who  is  the
sister and brother-in-law of Pravinchandra Patel and Anilkumar Patel
and parties have agreed to appoint them as arbitrators. It culminated
into  an  MOU dated  21.05.1996  appointing  Latikaben  and  Bhikhalal
Nathalal Patel as arbitrators which was signed by all the members of the
family that is the appellants and respondents. 
4.While arbitrators were away to Rajkot due to emergency work,
both Pravinchandra Patel and Anilkumar Patel decided to streamline the
ongoing business of firms and companies by signing of an interim MOU
on 29.06.1996  (IMOU).  The covenants of the said  IMOU covered the
matters relating to bank accounts and withdrawal power, NPK allocation
etc. The said IMOU was signed by Pravinchandra Patel for himself and
on behalf of his family members.  Similarly, Anilkumar Patel signed in
the IMOU for himself and also as a power of attorney holder for his wife,
his all sons and daughter-in-law.
5.The arbitrators arrived at Jalgaon on 04.07.1996 and continued
with the arbitration proceeding and passed the award on 07.07.1996
(with  a  mention  of  IMOU dated  29.06.1996)  under  which  certain
properties  were  given  to  Pravinchandra  Patel  and  Anilkumar  Patel
whereas some other assets were kept undivided with equal rights and
interest  thereon  of  both  groups.  The  award  was  written  in  Gujarati
3language by hand by the arbitrators and signed by the arbitrators. The
copy of the award was given to Pravinchandra Patel and Anilkumar
Patel by arbitrators in person which was duly acknowledged by them.
Copy of the award bears signature of both Pravinchandra Patel and
Anilkumar Patel with recital that they and their family members will act
as per the award and will give effect to the same. Then by an award
dated 03.11.1996, the issues between appellants and respondents were
finally decided taking note of earlier awards. According to Pravinchandra
Patel, Anilkumar Patel accepted and acted upon the awards on more
than one occasion.
6.However, Anilkumar Patel and his family members (appellant Nos.
1(a) to 1(d) and respondent No.10) filed an arbitration petition No.202 of
2005 under Section 34 of the Act before the District Judge, Jalgaon on
29.11.2005 challenging the award dated 07.07.1996 contending that
they learnt about the arbitral award only on 11.08.2005 when they were
served with the notice of execution petition filed by Pravinchandra Patel
alongwith the xerox of the award dated 07.07.1996. Therefore, as per
the  appellant-Anilkumar  Patel,  period  of  limitation  starts  only  from
11.08.2005, from the date of their receipt of copy of the award. It was
further alleged that, appellant Nos. 1(a) to 1(d) and respondent No.10
were not included as party in the award dated 07.07.1996 and the
4award is not binding on them. They have,  inter alia,  alleged that the
award is a false and fraudulent document.  They also emphasized that
the  signature  of  Anilkumar  Patel  in  the  arbitral  award  showing  his
acknowledgement was forged and therefore, could not be acted upon.
7.Later on, an application came to be filed by Anilkumar Patel for
himself and on behalf of his family members for an amendment under
Order VI Rule 17 C.P.C. stating that the arbitration petition No.202 of
2005  filed  initially,  did  not  contain  the  challenge  to  award  dated
03.11.1996 and hence, by an amendment sought to challenge award
dated  03.11.1996  as  well.  The  said  application  was  dismissed  on
30.06.2006 by the District Court on the ground of limitation which was
further challenged through W.P. No.5502 of 2006 before the High Court.
The  same  was  remanded  to  the  District  Judge  on  21.08.2006  for
consideration of the matter afresh. After remand, the District Judge by
order dated 28.09.2006 again dismissed the amendment application on
the ground of limitation. The said order dated 28.09.2006 was again
challenged by Anilkumar Patel under W.P. No.7614 of 2006. The High
Court vide order dated 13.11.2006 dismissed the writ petition observing
that Anilkumar Patel is adopting tactics of approbate and reprobate and
Anilkumar  Patel  is  acting  as  per  his  convenience  by  denying  the
knowledge  of  award  dated  03.11.1996  in  some  court  proceedings
5though in some other proceedings, he has relied on the said award and
sought to take advantage on the basis of the said award. 
8.Insofar  as  the  challenge  to  the  award  dated  07.07.1996,  the
District  Judge  vide  order  dated  14.02.2011  allowed  the  application
under Section 34 of the Act inter alia, holding that the period of limitation
prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Act is to be computed from the
point of time when the party concerned received the copy of the arbitral
award.  The District Judge set aside the award holding that number of
serious issues have been raised in application under Section 34 and
there is nothing to show that Anilkumar Patel was authorised by the
other applicants to receive a copy of the award on their behalf and it
cannot be said that the appellant Nos.1(a) to 1(d) and respondent No.10
had received the award in terms of Section 31(5) of the Act.
9.Being aggrieved, Pravinchandra Patel filed W.P. No.4669 of 2011.
The High Court by the impugned judgment dated 27.03.2012 set aside
the order of the District Judge holding that the petition filed in the year
2005 under Section 34 of the Act was time barred. The High Court held
that sofaras the award dated 03.11.1996, the findings in W.P.No.7614 of
2006 have attained finality which has foreclosed the right of Anilkumar
Patel  to  challenge  the  award  dated  07.07.1996.  The  High  Court
enumerated various circumstances to hold that Anilkumar Patel and his
6family members were well aware of the award dated 07.07.1996. The
High  Court  also  relied  upon  various  correspondence  between  the
parties, legal proceedings etc. (O.A. No.298A/2001 etc.) to arrive at the
conclusion that Anilkumar Patel received the award dated 07.07.1996.
On those findings, the High Court held that the petition filed in the year
2005 under Section 34 of the Act is time barred and the petition filed
under Section 34 of the Act challenging the award dated 07.07.1996
came to be dismissed.
10. On behalf of legal heirs of Anilkumar Patel, it was contended that
as contemplated under Section 31(5) of the Act, copy of the award
dated  07.07.1996  was  not  served  upon  the  family  members  of
Anilkumar Patel and mere knowledge as to the existence of the award
would not in any manner result in the commencement of period of
limitation.  The learned senior counsel for the appellants contended that
the limitation period can be computed only from the day on which the
original signed copy of the arbitral award is received under the provision
of Section 31(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
11.Per contra, learned senior counsel for the respondents has drawn
our attention to number of documents to refute appellant's contention
wherein appellant-Anilkumar Patel himself admitted many times that the
arbitral award was within his knowledge and used the awards dated
707.07.1996  and  03.11.1996  on  number  of  occasions  including  legal
proceedings.  Further  contention  of  Pravinchandra  Patel  is  that
arbitrators who were none other than their sister Latikaben (respondent
No.12) and Bhikhalal Nathalal Patel (respondent No.11) husband of
Latikaben  who  came  from  Rajkot  to  Jalgaon  to  settle  the  matter
amicably between two brothers which was at the instance of both the
parties and while so, the award cannot be assailed as fabricated or a
biased one.
12.On the aforesaid rival contentions advanced on behalf of both the
parties  and  upon  perusal  of  the  impugned  judgment  and  materials
placed on record, the following points arise for consideration:-
(1)Whether Anilkumar Patel represented his family in the
arbitration proceedings and whether respondents are
right in contending that receipt of copy of award by
Anilkumar Patel was for himself and on behalf of his
family members?
(2)Whether the High Court was right in holding that the
application  under  Section  34  of  the  Arbitration  and
Conciliation Act, 1996 for setting aside the award was
barred by limitation?
13.Section 34 of the Act provides for filing of an application for setting
aside an arbitral award. Sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Act lays
8down the period of limitation for making the application.  Section 34(3)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, reads as follows:-
34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.- (1) Recourse to
a  Court  against  an  arbitral  award  may  be  made  only  by  an
application for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-
section (2) and sub-section (3).
(2).........
(3)An application for setting aside may not be made after three
months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that
application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been
made under Section 33, from the date on which that request had
been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal:
Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was
prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the
said period of three months it may entertain the application within a
further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.
14.Section 34(3) provides that an application for setting aside an
award shall not be entertained by the court if it is made after three
months have elapsed from the date on which the applicant had received
the arbitral award.  The proviso to Section 34 further provides that if the
court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause
from making the application within the prescribed time, it may entertain
the application within a further period of thirty days ' but not thereafter '.
(vide State of Arunachal Pradesh v. Damini Construction Co.  (2007) 10
SCC 742). The words ' but not thereafter ' in the proviso are of mandatory
9nature, and couched in the negative, and leave no room for doubt.
Proviso to Section 34 gives discretion to the court to condone the delay
for a sufficient cause, but that discretion cannot be extended beyond the
period of thirty days, which is made exclusively clear by use of the
words 'but not thereafter '.  
15.In  Union  of  India  v.  Tecco  Trichy  Engineers  and  Contractors
(2005) 4 SCC 239, a three Judge Bench of this Court, in respect to the
issue of limitation for filing application under Section 34 of the Act for
setting aside the arbitral award, held that the period of limitation would
commence only after a valid delivery of an arbitral award takes place
under Section 31(5) of the Act.  In para (8), this Court held as under:-
"8. The  delivery  of  an  arbitral  award  under  sub-section  (5)  of
Section  31  is  not  a  matter  of  mere  formality.  It  is  a  matter  of
substance. It is only after the stage under Section 31 has passed
that  the  stage  of  termination  of  arbitral  proceedings  within  the
meaning of Section 32 of the Act arises. The delivery of arbitral
award to the party, to be effective, has to be “received” by the party.
This delivery by the Arbitral Tribunal and receipt by the party of the
award  sets  in  motion  several  periods  of  limitation  such  as  an
application for correction and interpretation of an award within 30
days under Section 33(1), an application for making an additional
award under Section 33(4) and an application for setting aside an
award under Section 34(3) and so on. As this delivery of the copy of
award has the effect of conferring certain rights on the party as also
bringing to an end the right to exercise those rights on expiry of the
prescribed period of limitation which would be calculated from that
date, the delivery of the copy of award by the Tribunal and the
receipt thereof by each party constitutes an important stage in the
arbitral proceedings."
1016.In State of Maharashtra and Ors. v. Ark Builders Pvt. Ltd ., (2011) 4
SCC 616, while following the judgment in Tecco Trichy Engineers case ,
held that the expression "... party making that application had received
the  arbitral  award... "  cannot  be  read  in  isolation  and  it  must  be
understood that Section 31(5) of the Act requires a signed copy of the
award to be delivered to each party. By cumulative reading of Section
34(3) and Section 31(5) of the Act, it is clear that the limitation period
prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Act would commence only from
the date of signed copy of the award delivered to the party making the
application for setting it aside. 
17.Contention  of  the  appellants  is  that  the  other  members  of
Anilkumar's  family  viz.,  appellant  Nos.  1(a)  to  1(d)  and  respondent
No.10, appellant No.1(d) and respondent No.10 did not receive the copy
of the award and that they had knowledge of the award only when the
execution petition was filed and when they received the notice in the
execution  petition.   Contention  of  appellant  Nos.  1(a)  to  1(d)  and
respondent No.10 is that in terms of Section 31(5) of the Act, copy of the
award to be delivered to each party to enable them to challenge the
award and since the copy of the award not individually served to them,
the period of limitation would start only from the date when they got the
copy of the award.  
1118As pointed out earlier, Anilkumar Patel has signed the award and
received the copy of the award with the following endorsement:- 
"For myself and on behalf of my family members".
Whether the receipt of the award by Anilkumar Patel with the above
endorsement could be construed as the receipt of the award by his
family members-  appellant Nos.1(a) to 1(d) and respondent No.10 , is
the point falling for consideration. 
19.In  MOU dated 21.05.1996, Pravinchandra Patel and Anilkumar
Patel have appointed their sister Latikaben and her husband Bhikhalal
Nathalal Patel for effecting partition between the two families and both
the families have consented for the same. The  MOU was signed by
Pravinchandra Patel and his wife and daughters (respondents No.1 to
5)  and  Anilkumar  Patel  and  his  wife  and  his  three  sons  and  one
daughter-in-law (appellant No.1 (dead) and appellant Nos. 1(a) to 1(d)
and respondent No.10 ). The  MOU appointing arbitrators (21.05.1996)
stipulates that: (i) the award to be in writing; and (ii) to furnish copy of
the award to each of the members of the families. The relevant portion
of MOU reads as under:-
".....The arbitrators shall write down the particulars of the partition
as well as the terms and conditions for effecting the partition and
the arbitrators shall sign it. The arbitrators shall make as many
copies of it as there are members and shall give each member a
copy of it. And after that both the families shall act as per the
12particulars  of  partition  given  by  the  arbitrators  and  get  the
properties and business properties partitioned...."
20.As pointed out earlier, while arbitrators were away to Rajkot due
to  emergency  work,  both  Pravinchandra  Patel  and  Anilkumar  Patel
decided to streamline the ongoing business of firms and companies by
signing an interim  MOU on 29.06.1996 ( IMOU). The covenants of the
said IMOU covered the matters relating to bank account and withdrawal
of  power,  NPK  allocation  etc.  The  said  IMOU was  signed  by
Pravinchandra Patel with the following endorsement:-
"P.J. Patel (Group No.1) for self and also as Power of Attorney
Holder for wife and all daughters". 
Similarly in the said  IMOU, Anilkumar Patel signed for himself and on
behalf of his family members, as seen from the following endorsement:-
 "A.J. Patel (Group No.2) for Self and also as Power of Attorney
Holder for wife, all sons and daughter-in-law."
21.The award dated 07.07.1996 was signed by both the arbitrators.
The  award  was  also  signed  by  Pravinchandra  Patel  and  Anilkumar
Patel.  Both of them have undertaken to implement the award with their
free will and pleasure, as seen from the following:-
"As per this Arbitration "Award", both the groups and their family
members  have  to  honestly,  wholeheartedly  and  faithfully  act  in
accordance with and implement the transaction of the property, the
IMOU which is now considered as MOU and the accounting chart in
respect of the companies and the firms. 
........
13The aforesaid Arbitration Award I agreed to and approved of by and
our descendant guardian and heirs.  We undertake to implement
the same with free-will and pleasure."  
After  their  signature  in the  award  which is in  Gujarati language  for
having  received  the  copy  of  the  award,  Pravinchandra  Patel  and
Anilkumar Patel have stated as under:-
"....For ourselves and on behalf of our family members."
It  is  pertinent  to  note  that  the  award  also  referred  to  IMOU dated
29.06.1996 in and by which the members of the respective families
have authorized Pravinchandra Patel and Anilkumar Patel to act on
behalf of their family members. 
22.The  award  dated  03.11.1996  also  refers  to  the  award  dated
07.07.1996.  The  award  dated  03.11.1996  was  also  signed  by
Pravinchandra  Patel  and  Anilkumar  Patel  and  both  of  them  have
undertaken that the arbitration award is duly agreed and approved by
them  and  their  family  members  and  further  undertaken  to  act  in
accordance with the award and to give effect to the same.  The said
endorsement in the award dated 03.11.1996 reads as under:-
"The  aforesaid  arbitration  award  is  duly  agreed  to  and
approved of by me and my family members, descendants heirs and
other.
My  family  members  and  I  absolutely  assure  to  act  in
accordance with the award and to give effect to same."
14As discussed earlier, Anilkumar Patel was unsuccessful in his attempt to
challenge the award dated 03.11.1996 which has attained finality in
terms  of  the  findings  in  W.P.No.7614  of  2006.  Anilkumar  Patel's
undertaking  in  the  award  dated  03.11.1996  that  he  and  his  family
members agreed and approved the award shows that Anilkumar Patel
was acting for himself and on behalf of his family members.
23.Award  dated  07.07.1996  was  received  by  Anilkumar  Patel  for
himself and on behalf of his family members.  In interim MOU dated
29.06.1996, Anilkumar Patel signed for self and as a power of attorney
holder for his wife and his all sons and daughter-in-law.  Challenging the
award dated 07.07.1996, Anilkumar Patel and his family members have
filed a single petition under Section 34 of the Act. Likewise they have
also filed a single petition for amending the arbitration petition No.202 of
2005.  Anilkumar Patel, being the head of his family, was a person
directly connected with and involved in the proceeding and was also in
control of the proceeding.  Being head of the family, Anilkumar Patel
would have been the best person to understand and appreciate the
arbitral award and take a decision as to whether an application under
Section 34 of the Act was required to be filed or not.  In such facts and
circumstances,  in  our  considered  view,  service  of  arbitral  award  on
Anilkumar Patel amounts to service on the other appellant Nos.1(a) to
151(d) and respondent No.10 and they cannot plead non-compliance of
Section 31(5) of the Act.   
24.The  High  Court  has  enumerated  various  circumstances  which
indicate  that  Anilkumar  Patel  was  well  aware  of  the  award  dated
07.07.1996 and also relied upon the award in internal communication
between the parties and various legal proceedings. "Inter Office Memo"
dated  22.07.1996,  sent  by  Anilkumar  Patel  to  Pravinchandra  Patel,
seeking for delivery of file of Gat No.266/2 of Bambhori, Taluka Brandol.
Anilkumar  Patel  has  stated  that  in  Gat  No.266/2  of  Bambhori,
agricultural land has come to his share and since some dispute has
been raised by the party by whom the sale-deed is to be executed,
Anilkumar Patel requested to handover the file maintained in connection
with the agricultural land mentioned in Gat No.266/2.  The said Inter
Office Memo clearly shows that even on 22.07.1996, Anilkumar Patel
had acted upon the award dated 07.07.1996.
25.Central  Bank  of  India  has  filed  recovery  proceeding  in
O.A.No.298-A/2001  against  Pravinchandra  Patel,  M/s.  Patel
Narayandas Bhagwandas Fertilizers Private Limited and others.  In the
said  proceeding  before  DRT,  Anilkumar  Patel  has  referred  to  the
arbitration award passed in July, 1996 and that he has no interest in
M/s. Patel Narayandas Bhagwandas Fertilizers Private Limited.  Based
16on such stand taken by Anilkumar Patel in O.A.No.298-A/2001, DRT
observed that Anilkumar Patel had resigned from the Directorship of the
said company and exonerated him from the liability to the bank and
dismissed O.A.No.298-A/2001 against Anilkumar Patel and Atulkumar
Maganlal Patel.  The High Court referred to the said DRT proceedings
and various other circumstances in which Anilkumar Patel had taken
advantage of arbitration award and the High Court held as under:-
"....The respondents, obviously, wherever it was possible for them,
at several places, took advantage of the arbitration award and now
since obligation on their part is to be complied in favour of the
petitioner, have started challenging the award, after nine years....." 
Various circumstances brought on record clearly show that Anilkumar
Patel  was  authorized  by  other  appellant  Nos.  1(a)  to  1(d)  and
respondent No.10 to receive copy of the award and act on their behalf
and we find no reason to take a different view from that of the High
Court.  
26.As rightly observed by the High Court, Anilkumar Patel has gone
to  the  extent  of  even  disputing  his  signature  in  the  award  dated
07.07.1996 by drafting choreographed petition. Having  accepted the
award through Anilkumar Patel, being the head of the family, appellant
Nos. 1(a) to 1(d) and respondent No.10 cannot turn round and contend
that they had not received the copy of the award.  The High Court rightly
17held that "....Receiving the copy by Anilkumar on behalf of himself and
respondent  nos.  2  to  6,  under  an  acknowledgment,  is  in  terms  of
compliance of Section 31(5) of the Act and Section 34(3) thereof....."
and that the application filed under Section 34 of the Act by Anilkumar
Patel and appellant Nos. 1(a) to 1(d) and respondent No.10 was barred
by limitation.  We do not find any good ground to interfere with the
impugned judgment.  
27.In the result, the appeals are dismissed. No costs.
