                    <p className="card-text">A will is a testament or a written document through which an individual (testator) can describe how wealth of that individual is to be distributed among his/her descendants. The person making the Will can also name an executor i.e. a person who would carry out the proceedings of the Will, along with naming legal guardians for the testator’s children especially in case they are minors. It is a legal declaration regarding the distribution and management of property of a person after their death.
                    </p><p>
                    A Will must be made in order to decide who should receive your properties after your death. Making a Will avoids many future legal troubles and fights within the family. A Will also states how the property should be managed, thus leaving out ambiguities. It is also used to make sure that your children are taken care of as a guardian for them can also be appointed by way of a Will. Thus a Will is the best way to ensure safety and financial security for your family and loved ones.
